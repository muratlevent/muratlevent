### ‚ú® &nbsp;About Me

<p align="left">
  My journey began with small projects in Java, which laid the foundation for my understanding of object-oriented programming. Building on that foundation, I developed and launched an interactive, Kahoot-inspired game website using the Java Spring Boot framework. Eager to expand my technical horizons, I transitioned to mastering fundamental JavaScript and React. This shift allowed me to embrace the dynamic world of front-end development, leading me to create a currency exchange website currencypro.xyz. Currently, I am focusing on deepening my expertise in React.
